# good-omens-coffee

A simple side project I created using everything I learned from udemy courses.

- A website where a user can order coffee beans
- Fully responsive design
- In About Us page, there's an interactive map using HERE API.
- In Shop, users can see available beans, add beans to cart, and finally enter an address to make an order
- In Admin page, it's possible to register and login.
- After logging in and authorized, admins can add new beans, update new beans, and delete beans.
- Admins can also see orders made and delete them after they're completed.
